# Project Documentation Template Framework

A comprehensive framework for creating structured, consistent, and complete project documentation. This framework is designed to work with the Windsurf Memory System, providing continuity across AI assistant sessions.

## Overview

This repository contains a collection of standardized templates and tools for documenting all aspects of a software project, from initial concepts through implementation details. The framework is specifically designed to:

1. Provide consistent structure across all project documentation
2. Ensure completeness by addressing all critical aspects of a project
3. Integrate with the Windsurf Memory System for AI continuity across sessions
4. Support automated dependency documentation
5. Implement the self-critique cycle for continuous improvement

## Template Framework Components

### Core Documentation Templates

The framework includes templates for documenting all key aspects of a software project:

- **Project Overview**: Vision, problem statement, target audience, success metrics
- **Features**: Core feature specifications, components, roadmap, dependencies
- **Requirements**: Functional and technical requirements with performance metrics
- **Tech Stack**: Frontend, backend, infrastructure, and tools with rationale
- **Dependencies**: Comprehensive inventory with documentation links
- **User Flow**: End-to-end user journey mapping with error handling
- **Implementation**: Code standards, organization, and examples
- **Project Structure**: Directory organization, naming conventions, configuration

### Meta-Workflow Integration

- XML-based function mapping for documentation components
- Memory system integration for continuity across sessions
- Self-critique cycle implementation for documentation improvement
- Task log integration for tracking documentation changes

### Automation Tools

- Dependency documentation automation helpers
- Memory bank initialization procedures
- Documentation function maps for AI assistants

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository into your project
2. Copy the templates you need to your documentation directory
3. Fill out the templates starting with the project overview
4. Use the meta-workflow integration to maintain documentation consistency
5. Update documentation as your project evolves

## Features

### Structured Approach

All templates follow a consistent approach to documentation:

- Clear section hierarchy for easy navigation
- Placeholder text with guidance on what to include
- Examples of well-written documentation
- Cross-references between related documentation

### Memory System Integration

The framework integrates with the Windsurf Memory System:

- Version history tracking
- Memory context relationships
- Next steps documentation
- Memory bank status tracking

### Self-Critique Cycle

Documentation is improved through a four-phase cycle:

1. **Creator Phase**: Generate comprehensive initial documentation
2. **Critic Phase**: Identify weaknesses, gaps, and assumptions
3. **Defender Phase**: Address each criticism with specific improvements
4. **Judge Phase**: Evaluate original and improved documentation

### Automation Support

Includes tools for automating documentation tasks:

- Dependency extraction and research
- Version compatibility analysis
- Documentation URL collection
- Memory bank initialization

## Best Practices

For effective documentation:

1. **Start Early**: Begin documenting at the project's inception
2. **Be Specific**: Use concrete examples and measurable criteria
3. **Focus on Why**: Explain rationale, not just implementation details
4. **Keep Updated**: Regularly review and update documentation
5. **Integrate with Workflow**: Make documentation part of the development process
