## Next Steps for use with the Engineered Meta-Cognitive Workflow Architecture

1. Use the template above to create your project overview using your specific project details. *tip*: Ask the model to output the result in a code block for easy copy/paste.
2. Give the template and your prompt to any chat AI like Claude, ChatGPT, or Deepseek R1. 
3. The chat model will generate a project overview based on your prompt and the template
4. Start a new project in Windsurf and install the prompt and `.windsurfrules` using the guide at the top of this page.
5. Copy the project template into the new project or just paste the contents into Cascade.
6. Follow the "best practices" guide above to get the best result.

## Resources for Creating a Project Overview
Claude.ai and Openai.com are fairly well known and obvious resources. However, here are some other resources with free models:
